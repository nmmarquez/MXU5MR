###Key Points

####Question: How is Mexico achieving its under 5 mortality goals?

Findings: While National level mortality child mortality rates has been reduced
by two thirds within Mexico between 1990 and 2015 there exist a large amount of
inequity in those rates among districts

Meaning: How countries achieve MDG5 goals need to be examined such that we can
examine if communities within countries are being further marginalized.

##Abstract

####Importance
By evaluating 5q0 and child mortality at more granular levels we can begin to
asses the state of health disparities that exist within a single country

####Objective
To provide estimates of the changing under 5 mortality landscape at the district
level between 2006 and 2014 and describe how the distribution of mortality among
districts has changed over time.

####Design
Under 5 mortality count data were taken from registrations reported by
Subsistema de Información sobre Nacimientos (SINAC) and Instituto Nacional de
Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) while population data was calculated from birth
record data from each district as reported by INEGI. Mortality counts were
estimated from this data using a poisson hierarchical mixed effects regression
where the relative risk was taken as the mortality rate estimate for a given
municipality.

##Introduction

In 2015 at the end of the tracking period of the Millennium goals the report
Countdown to 2015 the publication cited that of the 75 priority countries
followed by the analysis Mexico was part of the one third countries that was
successful in achieving the goal of reducing under 5 mortality by two thirds
[@victora_countdown_2016].
