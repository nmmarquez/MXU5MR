\begin{abstract}

Mexico has had dramatic declines in under 5 mortality from 1990 to 2015 and is one of only a handful of countries that have reached the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) of reducing national level mortality by two thirds from 48 to 16 deaths per 1000 live births. While national level reports of mortality have been made by several international groups and have tracked the changes in Mexico's under  mortality, no study to date has done a comparative assessment of the differential levels of child mortality within Mexico by municipality. In order to assess how municipalities differ in their under 5 mortality rate and probability of death before age 5 ($~_{5}q_{0}$) we calculate age specific mortality rate using spatiotemporal age models. In addition, we assess the difference in time from birth till registration by municipality for all births recorded in the years 2000-2015 in order to assess quality of vital registration.

\section*{Main Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Understand the difference in quality of Vital Registration Data at the municipality level.
\item Build a fulll time series of estimates for age specific child mortality and$~_{5}q_{0}$ for all 2456 municipalities for years 2000-2015.
\item Assess changes in distribution of$~_{5}q_{0}$ experience.
\item Decompose the relative contribution made from real change and compositioinal changes of$~_{5}q_{0}$.
\end{enumerate}

%	MATERIALS AND METHODS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Materials and Methods}

De-identified person level data was extracted from INEGI and SINAC vital registration reports for the years 2000 to 2015 for birth records. Of the 43,594,696 birth records that were extracted 99.65\% had a properly identified household location of parents that was used as the geolocation for this analysis, placing each record in one of the 2456 municipalities within Mexico. The records that did not have a municipality associated with them were approximately evenly distributed across states and were discarded from the analysis. Death registration data was extracted from person level de-identified INEGI reports where municipality of residence, year of occurrence, and age of individual given by single year was used provided that information existed for the death record. Of the 592274 deaths that were reported as under the age of 5, 99.72\% had values for year, age, and municipality that were valid. Since data was not linked by person and single year populations by single year age and municipality were not available in other data sources, populations were estimated by taking the births of individuals for a particular municipality age and moving them one year forward in age as calendar year progressed, while also subtracting the deaths for that population. The formula is as follows where $P$ is population number, $D$ is death number, $a$ is a single year age, $t$ is a single year time period, and $l$ is a municipality.

$$
P_{l,a,t} = P_{l,a-1,t-1} - D_{l,a-1,t-1}
$$

%This cohort method of tracking mortality and populations makes the assumption of net zero migration for all demographic units.

\section*{Results}

Analysis of time from birth until registration showed that there was a significant amount of variability in the distribution of births at each municipality with a mean time of .6  and a standard deviation of .4. In addition to this variability there was a strong geographic correlation between the time delay of births until time to registration with a Moran's I of .7661 (p $<$ .01) indicative of strong positive geographic autocorrelation(figure 1).

Results from a multidimensional,age, time and geography, Gaussian Markov Random Field latent model were used in the final estimation of municipality age specific child mortality and used to estimate$~_{5}q_{0}$ at the municipality level. Anaysis of$~_{5}q_{0}$ found that there was a significant decline in the level of inequality of lived$~_{5}q_{0}$ though all metrics showed this level stabalizing in recent years. Though inequality dcereased in the observed time series the relative positioning of municipalities were strongly correlated between 2000 and 2015 , 0.6232 (0.5903-0.6549), suggesting that municipalities that had relatively poor child mortality as measured by$~_{5}q_{0}$ within Mexico in 2000 continued to perform poorly relative to the national average in 2015.

Decomposing changes to the national level$~_{5}q_{0}$ into compositional changes and real rate changes found that 99.5\% of the changes to national$~_{5}q_{0}$ came from real declines in rates among Mexican municipalities. Around 50\% of the decline observed between 2000 and 2015 was made by only 20\% of the population, which likely contributed to the decline in measures of inequality. Furthermore, ordering the municipalities from the largest to the smallest organizational units, we found that a nearly equal contribution to the change in national level$~_{5}q_{0}$ came from the smallest 50\% and the largest 50\% of the municipalities. The municipalities that most hindered the decline in national$~_{5}q_{0}$ were largely due to increases in the population size and their relative contribution to the national average.

Examining the lowest and highest 30 municipalities of$~_{5}q_{0}$ found that Oaxaca, which contains around 25\% of the country's municipalities, makes up 43\% of the highest observed$~_{5}q_{0}$ municipalities as well as 53\% of the lowest observed$~_{5}q_{0}$ municipalities. Looking at just Oaxaca, the state level inequalities have not significantly changed over the observed time period. Other low performers in terms of relative level of 2015$~_{5}q_{0}$ come from the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Chihuahua while high performing municipalities are located in Tamaulipas, Yucatan, and Michoacan de Ocampo.

\section*{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Birth vital registration quality is heterogenous across Mexico and is significantly spatially correlated.
\item Additional evidence of reducing child mortality and inequality at national level.
\item Reduction has largely come from real changes in rate rather than compositional changes.
\item Mexico has stagnated in reducing inequality of child mortality in both relative and absolute measures.
\item State level performance of reduction and inequality of$~_{5}q_{0}$ measures is heterogenous.
\end{itemize}
